%We don't filter based on the percentage of mapped reads. Instead we filter based on heterozygosity. The two parameters are related.

%“Version 4 has multiple improvements: support for multi-allelic markers” – BEAGLE4 site

%An improved method for calling genotypes and phasing low-coverage data when one also has chip data is to phase the chip data to make a haplotype scaffold and then phase the sequence data onto the scaffold. Both steps are carried out with SHAPEIT2.
