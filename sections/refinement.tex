\subsection{Genotype refinement and phasing}
Initial refinement of genotype likelihoods is carried out with Beagle4. Chip data available for the same populations, which has undergone QC, will be phased with SHAPEIT2 across all populations. This will provide a haplotype scaffold for MVNcall, which will be used for the final refinement. 2.5M SNPs has been shown to be an optimal/sufficient haplotype scaffold size in African populations.\cite{Menelaou2013} Pedigree information will be used by Beagle4 and SHAPEIT2, when available. Prior to refinement with Beagle4 we recode haploid male genotypes (non-PAR X and Y) to homozygous diploid genotypes. We use the duoHMM method of SHAPEIT2 for phasing, because it has been shown to have a lower switch error rate, when pedigree information is available.\cite{OConnell2014}
