\section{Evaluation of Variant Callers}
\subsection{Introduction}
We need to generate a set of high quality variants to be used in a reference panel and to be used as a set of candidate SNPs for tagSNP selection. Therefore it important to evaluate the various methods for calling variants such as SNPs, short indels and structural variants (SVs) for the sequence reads.
\subsection{Methods}
