\section{Validation of selected tag SNPs}

As sequence data, particularly low coverage short read data has been prone to sequencing errors, we will validate all tagging sites based on a large data repository of validated variant sites collated by the vendor. Novel variant sites will be further validated by the vendor, prior to chip design, and proxies of sites that cannot be covered will be investigated and filled in for generation of the final array.

We will check that no SNPs are within 10bp of each other. To ensure good coverage across the genome we will also check that no intervals outside of the centromere regions without tag SNPs in them are longer than 5kbp.
