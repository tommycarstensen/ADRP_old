\subsection{Alignment and preprocessing of reads}
Following generation of raw reads mapping will be carried out to the human reference genome (GRCh37) using the BWA-MEM algorithm of the BWA software package, which is suitable for Illumina reads longer than 70bp.\cite{2013arXiv1303.3997L} Optical and PCR duplicate reads will be marked with Picard MarkDuplicates on a lanelet level. The reads will be sorted by coordinate with samtools sort. The lanelets will be merged to a library level with Picard MergeSamFiles, and duplicate reads will be marked on a library level. The BAMs will be merged to a sample level and then sample level bam improvement will be carried out using GATKv2.8+. This process will consist of a per-sample realignment of reads around known and discovered indels with GATK RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner in addition to base quality score recalibration (BQSR) with GATK BaseRecalibrator and PrintReads.
