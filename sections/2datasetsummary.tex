\section{Summary of Datasets}
The chip design will incorporate several population groups collated from different parts of Africa. These include samples collated as part of the AGVP, the Genome Diversity in Africa Project (AGVP), the 1000 Genomes project (\href{http://www.1000genomes.org}{http://www.1000genomes.org}), the Simonâ€™s Foundation (\href{http://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-genome-diversity-project-dataset/}{http://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-genome-diversity-project-dataset/}), and other shared or publicly available data. These samples have been chosen to be representative of diverse ethno-linguistic and geographical groups across Africa.
